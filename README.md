The **Simple Rule Engine** is a lightweight library for creating, combining, and evaluating (nested) rules. Inspired by Django's `Q` object, it allows you to construct complex logical conditions and evaluate them against dictionaries of data.

## Quickstart

```
pip install rule_engine
```

```python
from rule_engine import Rule, evaluate

# Rule: (foo == "bar" OR foo == "baz") AND (name == "John" AND age >= 21)
rule = Rule(
    Rule(foo="bar") | Rule(foo="baz"),
    name="John", age__gte=21
)

example_true = {"foo": "bar", "name": "John", "age": 22}
example_false = {"foo": "qux", "name": "Jane", "age": 19}

print(evaluate(rule, example_true))  # True
print(evaluate(rule, example_false))  # False
```


## Features

- Create rules with simple conditions or nested logic.
- Combine rules using logical operators:
  - `&` (AND)
  - `|` (OR)
  - `~` (NOT)
- Evaluate rules against dictionaries of values.
- Supports a wide range of operators (listed below).
- Extensible: Add your own custom operators if needed.

## Installation

pip install rule-engine
```

## Basic Usage

### Creating Rules

Rules can be created using the `Rule` object. You can pass positional arguments (`*args`) for nested rules and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) for conditions.

```python
from rule_engine import Rule

# Simple rule with conditions
rule = Rule(name="John", age__gte=21)

# Nested rules with logical operators
complex_rule = Rule(
    Rule(name="John") & Rule(age__gte=21),
    Rule(name="Jane") | Rule(age__lt=20)
)
```

### Logical Operators

- `&` (AND): Combines rules that must all be satisfied.
- `|` (OR): Combines rules where at least one must be satisfied.
- `~` (NOT): Negates a rule.

Example:

```python
from rule_engine import Rule

# Rule: (name == "John" AND age >= 21) OR (name == "Jane" AND age < 20)
rule = Rule(
    Rule(name="John") & Rule(age__gte=21) |
    Rule(name="Jane") & Rule(age__lt=20)
)
```

Alternatively, you can also express this in the following fashion:

```python
from rule_engine import Rule

rule = Rule(name="John", age__gte=21) | Rule(name="Jane", age__lt=20)
```

### Evaluating Rules
To evaluate a rule, use the evaluate function or the evaluate method of the rule. Provide a dictionary of data to check the rule against.

```python
from rule_engine import Rule, evaluate

# Rule: (foo == "bar" OR foo == "baz") AND (name == "John" AND age >= 21)
rule = Rule(
    Rule(foo="bar") | Rule(foo="baz"),
    name="John", age__gte=21
)

example_true = {"foo": "bar", "name": "John", "age": 22}
example_false = {"foo": "qux", "name": "Jane", "age": 19}

print(evaluate(rule, example_true))  # True
print(evaluate(rule, example_false))  # False
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Operators

You can extend the rule engine by adding new operators.
Use the func operator for custom logic, or modify the `OPERATOR_FUNCTIONS` dictionary for persistent custom operators.

Example with func:
    
```python
from rule_engine import Rule

# Custom condition: Check if a value is a palindrome
is_palindrome = lambda x: str(x) == str(x)[::-1]

rule = Rule(word__func=is_palindrome)

example_true = {"word": "radar"}
example_false = {"word": "hello"}

print(rule.evaluate(example_true))  # True
print(rule.evaluate(example_false))  # False
```

## Full example

```python
from rule_engine import Rule, evaluate

# Complex rule example
rule = Rule(
    Rule(credit_rating__gte=50, flood_risk__lt=10) |
    Rule(revenue__gt=1_000_000)
)

data = {"credit_rating": 55, "flood_risk": 5}
print(evaluate(rule, data))  # True

data = {"revenue": 1_500_000}
print(evaluate(rule, data))  # True

data = {"credit_rating": 40, "flood_risk": 15, "revenue": 500_000}
print(evaluate(rule, data))  # False
```
